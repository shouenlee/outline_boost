**I. In 2 Corinthians Christ as the grace of God is the good land for us to enter into, experience, enjoy, partake of, and pos- sess-John 1:17; 1 Cor. 15:10; cf. Gal. 2:20; 1 Cor. 5:7; 10:3-4; 2 Cor. 13:14:**

>2 Cor. 13:14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
, 2 Cor. 1:12 For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
, 2 Cor. 4:15 For all things are for your sakes that the grace which has abounded through the greater number may cause the thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.

, 2 Cor. 12:9 And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.

>>John 14:26, John 15:26, 1 John 4:13

>>2. The blessing in 2 Corinthians 13:14 is the same as that in Numbers 6:22-27; this is the eternal blessing of the Triune God, which is the Triune God dispensing Himself in His Divine Trinity into us for our enjoyment:

>>2 Corinthians 13:14, Numbers 6:22-27

>>2 Cor. 13:14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

>>John 1:16

>>John 1:16 For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.


>C. The new covenant ministers' living is the living of grace, the ex- perience of grace-Heb. 12:28; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 1:12, 15:

>Hebrews 12:28, 1 Corinthians 15:10, 2 Corinthians 1:12, 2 Corinthians 15

>Heb. 12:28 Therefore receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly with piety and fear;
, 1 Cor. 15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
, 2 Cor. 1:12 For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.


>>1. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Spirit of grace, is with our spirit, which has been regenerated to be the dwelling place and vessel of the Triune God-Heb. 10:29b; Gal. 6:18; Phil. 4:23; Philem. 25; 2 Tim. 4:22; cf. 1:6-7.

, Phil. 4:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
, 2 Tim. 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.

>>Hebrews 4:16, Genesis 28:12-17, John 1:51, Ephesians 2:22

>>Heb. 4:16 Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help.
, Gen. 28:12 And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
Gen. 28:13 And there was Jehovah, standing above it; and He said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give to you and to your seed.
Gen. 28:14 And your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed.
Gen. 28:15 And, behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will cause you to return to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.

>>3. Grace is with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibility-6:24.

>>Jude 6:24

>>

>>4. Humility saves us from all kinds of destruction and invites God's grace-1 Pet. 5:5-6; James 4:6.

>>1 Peter 5:5, 1 Peter 5:6, James 4:6

>>1 Pet. 5:5 In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders; and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.
, 1 Pet. 5:6 Therefore be humbled under the mighty hand of God that He may exalt you in due time,
, James 4:6 But He gives greater grace; therefore it says, "God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble."

>>Acts 20:32, Jeremiah 15:16

>>Acts 20:32 And now I commit you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who have been sanctified.

>>7. The new covenant ministers enjoy Christ as their all-sufficient grace through sufferings:

>>None found

>>

>>>a. The ministry of the new covenant is produced by revelation plus suffering-2 Cor. 12:7; 1:3-4, 8-10.

>>>2 Corinthians 12:7, 2 Corinthians 1:3-4, 2 Corinthians 1:8-10

>>>2 Cor. 12:7 And because of the transcendence of the revelations, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, that he might buffet me, in order that I might not be exceedingly lifted up.
, 2 Cor. 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions and God of all comfort,
2 Cor. 1:4 Who comforts us in all our affliction that we may be able to comfort those who are in every affliction through the comforting with which we ourselves are comforted by God.

, 2 Cor. 1:8 For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living.
2 Cor. 1:9 Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead;
2 Cor. 1:10 Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us,

>>Exo. 19:4 You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to Myself.
, Isa. 40:31 Yet those who wait on Jehovah will renew their strength; / They will mount up with wings like eagles; / They will run and will not become weary; / They will walk and will not faint.
, 2 Cor. 4:7 But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us.
, 2 Cor. 1:12 For our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you.
, 2 Cor. 12:9 And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.
, 1 Cor. 15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.
, Psa. 17:8 Guard me like the pupil of Your eye; / In the shadow of Your wings hide me
, Psa. 57:1 Be gracious to me, O God, be gracious to me; / For my soul takes refuge in You; / Indeed in the shadow of Your wings I will take refuge, / Until the destruction passes by.
, Psa. 63:7 For You have been my help, / And in the shadow of Your wings I will shout for joy.
, Psa. 91:4 With His pinions He will cover You, / And under His wings You will take refuge; / His truth is a shield and a buckler.


>>9. We reign in life by receiving the abundance of grace-Rom. 5:17.

>>Romans 5:17

>>Rom. 5:17 For if, by the offense of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.


>>10. We need to be good stewards of the varied grace of God-1 Pet. 4:10; Eph. 3:2. V

>>1 Peter 4:10, Ephesians 3:2

>>1 Pet. 4:10 Each one, as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.
, Eph. 3:2 If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you,


>>11. Our word should convey grace to the hearers-Luke 4:22; Eph. 4:29; Isa. 50:4.

>>Luke 4:22, Ephesians 4:29, Isaiah 50:4

>>Luke 4:22 And all bore witness to Him and marveled at the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth, and they said, Is not this Joseph's son?
, Eph. 4:29 Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.
, Isa. 50:4 The Lord Jehovah has given me / The tongue of the instructed, / That I should know how to sustain the weary with a word. / He awakens me morning by morning; / He awakens my ear / To hear as an instructed one.


>>12. We need to enjoy the grace of life in the church life to keep ourselves in the genuine oneness-Psa. 133.

>>Psalm 133

>>Psa. 133:1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is / For brothers to dwell in unity!
Psa. 133:2 It is like the fine oil upon the head / That ran down upon the beard, / Upon Aaron's beard, / That ran down upon the hem of his garments;
Psa. 133:3 Like the dew of Hermon / That came down upon the mountains of Zion. / For there Jehovah commanded the blessing: / Life forever.



>>13. In the church life, when we have grace upon us, the church will be built up, and the grace that we receive will be visible-Acts 4:33; 11:23.

>>Acts 4:33, Acts 11:23

>>Acts 4:33 And with great power the apostles gave testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
, Acts 11:23 Who, when he arrived and saw the grace of God, rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain with the Lord with purpose of heart;
